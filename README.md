# Radix Sort Implementation Assignment

## Objective
Your task is to implement the Radix Sort algorithm in Python.

## Requirements
- The implementation should be done in the provided `radix_sort.py` file.
- Your function should be named `radix_sort`.
- Ensure your code passes all the tests in `test_radix_sort.py`.

## Getting Started
1. **Login to Github:** The homework repository will be private, so to clone a private repository you first need to login in your terminal.
Use following command to login.
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
You can install ```gh``` from [here](https://cli.github.com/).

2. **Fork the Repository:** The Github classroom assignment will automatically create a fork of the repository for you after you accept the assignment.
3. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine. This will allow you to edit and test your code on your own device.

   ```bash
   git clone [URL of your forked repository]
   ```
   This would look like:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CSUF-CPSC-335/Homework2-CountSort-username.git
   ```
   Replace username with your github username.
   
5. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository:** Move into the directory for this specific homework assignment:
   ```bash
   cd homework2-username
   ```
   
4. **Write your code:** Write your code in the file radix_sort.py.

6. **Add the changes you made:** Add the changes your made to the radix_sort.py to start the commit process.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit the changes made:** Commit the changes made.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Submission"
   ```

6. **Push request to main branch:** Push your changes to the github repository.
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Submission
Submit your solution by pushing `radix_sort.py` to this repository after adding your code to the file. Make submission before the deadline as github will not accept any submissions after that.

## Deadline
Submit your assignment by 02/13/24 5:00 PM.

Good luck!
